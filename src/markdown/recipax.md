Recipax is a nutrition / meal prep app that I am currently developing / architecting. I'm writing the front end with React with Typescript, using the Controller higher-order-component design pattern for scalabilty / code cleanliness. For state management, I decided to roll with Redux & Redux-Thunk for handling asynchronous tasks.

The backend is running on Node with the NestJS framework (also written in Typescript). The database of choice is MySQL, with TypeORM as my ORM.

This project is currently on hold due to client freelance obligations.
