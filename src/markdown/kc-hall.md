The O'Fallon KC Hall reached out to me to create a simple, low-budget website to replace their current outdated webpage. I decided to experiment with GatsbyJS, which a React framework that includes code optimizations out of the box.

Additionally, I did all of the design work, from prototyping to full sketch mockups.
